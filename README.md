# Python exercises

A set of Python3 exercises to develop solid scripting foundations

## Description

These Python3 exercises will be numbered and go from easy to more advanced.
Problems will be added through time and solutions should be added a week or two
after each problem.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to help you gain experience in what many
introductions to programming in Python avoid: writing scripts that run on your
own computer, as opposed to a web imbedded interpreter, and produce useful
results. As a result, a lot of the exercises will require parsing user input
given on the command line as well as reading and writing files as these are
fundamental notions for scripting.

## How to use this repository

For each problem:

- Read the problem description
- Use the solution template if available
- Write a Python3 script that solves the problem
- Check the solution(s) for more learning opportunities
- Solutions should work with Python 3.6+
- Solutions whould work under Windows, Mac, and Linux
- You can re-use ideas from previous solutions
- You are also encouraged to try new ideas

## What you will learn

The exercises will practice:

- Using Python scripts that start with `#!/usr/bin/env python`
- Writing useful docstrings and using them (`__doc__`)
- Parsing user input (with `sys.argv` and the `argparse` module)
- Using the basic data types (numbers, strings, lists, tuples...)
- Reading and writing files
- Reading from and writing to compressed files with the `gzip` module
- Simplifying programs by using appropriate data structures
- Creating tree-like structures with dictionaries
- Using more advanced functionalities (`defaultdict`...)
- Keeping data well organized with simple classes
- Using paths properly in all OSes (Windows, Mac, Linux...) with the `os` module
- Simple search and replace and with regular expressions using the `re` module
