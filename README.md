# Python exercises

A set of Python3 exercises to develop solid scripting foundations

Before going through these exercices, you should be familiar with sections 2 to
8 of the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/). Some
sections have `See also` links. Please consult these also.

Sections 9, 10, and 11 of the official Python tutorial are more advanced material
that is worth looking at once you are comfortable with the previous sections.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to help you gain experience in what many
introductions to programming in Python avoid: writing useful scripts that **run
on your own computer**, as opposed to an embedded browser interpreter or an
iPython notebook.

As a result, a lot of the exercises will require parsing user input given on
the command line as well as reading and writing files. These are fundamental
notions for scripting that are too often ommited from introductory material.

The exercises will be numbered and go from easy to more advanced. Problems will
be added through time and solutions should be added a week or two after each
problem.

## How to use this repository

For each problem:

- Read the problem description in its `.py` file
- Build your solution by filling the template
- Check the solution(s) for more learning opportunities
- Solutions should work with Python 3.6+ under Windows, Mac, and Linux
- You can and should re-use ideas from previous solutions
- You are encouraged to experiment with new ideas

## What you will learn

The exercises will provide practice for:

- Using Python scripts that start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Writing useful documentation strings (aka: docstrings) and using them (`__doc__`)
- Parsing user input (with `sys.argv` and the `argparse` module)
- Making sure input values are valid
- Using the basic data types (numbers, strings, lists, tuples...)
- Reading and writing files
- Reading from and writing to compressed files with the `gzip` module
- Simplifying programs by using appropriate data structures
- Creating tree-like structures with dictionaries
- Using more advanced functionalities (`defaultdict`...)
- Keeping data well organized with simple classes
- Using paths properly in all OSes (Windows, Mac, Linux...) with the `os` module
- Simple search and replace and with regular expressions using the `re` module
