# Ideas for future problems

## 2017
### Basic
#### Week 1 - Nov 14
- 01 Hello world
  - shebang `!# /usr/bin/env python3`
  - Make script executable
  - Launch with `python <script.py>` or `./<script.py>`

- 02 User input
  - Use `sys.argv` to get user input
  - Run `./<script.py> name age`
  - Return "Hello {name}. You are {age} years old"

#### Week 2 - Nov 21
- 03 Documentation and try/except
  - Parse user input with `sys.argv`
  - Run without (or wrong number of) arguments
  - Return docstring (`__doc__`)

- 04 Assertions
  - Insure parameters have meaninfull values with `assert`

#### Week 3 - Nov 28
- 05 The PATH
  - Make your script visible from everywhere
  - Launch it without a path with `<script.py>`

- 06 Simple Math (wrap-up of learned skills) [Needed?]
  - shebang
  - docstring
  - user input = two numbers and a sign (`+ - * /`)
  - print result as an equation, example: "3 + 5 = 8"
  - Create a folder for your scripts and add it to your PATH

### Playing with files

#### Week 4 - Dec 5
- 07 Reading a file

#### Week 5 - Dec 12
- 08 Writing a file

#### Week 6 - Dec 19
- 09 Reading and writing from `gzip` compressed files

## 2018
## Data parsing and reporting
- Parse data from a file and report infos
- Parse data from two files, merge some infos, and report

## Data structures
- Default dictionaries
- Trees with dictionaries
- Basic classes

## Useful modules
- Argparse
- Paths with `os` module
- Regular expression with `re` module
- Module `collections`
- Module `itertools`
