# Ideas for future problems

## Basic

x Hello world script
  - Use shebang line: `!# /usr/bin/env python`
  - Make script executable
  - Launch with `python hello_world.py` or `./hello_world.py`

x Parsing user input
  - Use `sys.argv`
  - Run `./user_input.py name age`
  - Return "Hello {name}. You are {age} years old"

- Documentation and try/except
  - Parse user input with `sys.argv`
  - Run without (or wrong number of) arguments
  - Return docstring (`__doc__`)

- Assertions
  - Insure parameters have meaninfull values with `assert`

- The PATH variable
  - Make your script visible from everywhere
  - Launch it without a path with `script.py`

- Simple Math (wrap-up of learned skills) [Needed?]
  - shebang
  - docstring
  - user input = two numbers and a sign (`+ - * /`)
  - print result as an equation, example: "3 + 5 = 8"
  - Create a folder for your scripts and add it to your PATH

## Playing with files

- Reading a file
- Writing a file
- Reading and writing from `gzip` compressed files

## Data parsing and reporting

- Parse data from a file and report infos
- Parse data from two files, merge some infos, and report

## Data structures

- Default dictionaries
- Trees with dictionaries
- Basic classes

## Useful modules

- Argparse
- Paths with `os` module
- Regular expression with `re` module
- Module `collections`
- Module `itertools`
